#### Processos de Debug

Debugging Processes explores some excellent debugging tools for Node,
along with techniques and practices to increase visibility and process
information as we encounter debugging scenarios

Este capítulo explora algumas ferramentas de depuração para node, junto com técnicas e práticas para melhorar a visibilidade e processar informações à medida que encontramos cenários de depuração.

- Depurando Node com Chrome Devtools
- Aprimorando stack trace output
- Habilitando debug logs
- Habilitando core debug logs

#### Escrevendo Modules

Writing Modules teaches how Node's module system works and how to
create modules for various scenarios according to industry best practices.

#### Coordenando I/Os

Coordinating I/O explores some core APIs provided by Node, along with a
few third-party utilities that allow us to interact with standard I/O, the
filesystem, and the network stack.

#### Usando Streams

Using Streams explains why streams are so important, how they bring
functional programming to an asynchronous world, and how to avoid stream
gotchas.

#### Manejando protocolos Web

Wielding Web Protocols demonstrates how to work with the web at a low
level without using web framework. In this chapter, we will explore how to
implement clients and servers using various web protocols, including HTTP,
SMTP, and WebSockets.

#### Persistindo em bancos de dados

Persisting to Databases takes you through a cross-section of database
systems, such as MySQL/MariaDB, Postgres, Redis, MongoDB, and
LevelDB, and how to interact with them from within a Node process.

#### Trabalhando com Framework Webs

Working with Web Frameworks is an exploration creating web
applications with three of the most popular web frameworks: Express, Hapi,
and Koa. From scaffolding to using middleware/plugins, to working with
views, to implementing authentication, this chapter supplies a comprehensive
tour through creating a web application with a web framework in Node.js.

#### Lidando com Segurança

Dealing with Security covers various attacks that can be made against a
system and shows common programmer errors that lead to vulnerable
systems, along with some best practices and approaches that help create
secure systems.

#### Otimizando Performance

Optimizing Performance provides an optimization workflow focused on
measurement, alteration, and iteration. This chapter demonstrates how to
identify bottlenecks, refactor for performance, and develop habits for writing
efficient, optimizable JavaScript as an everyday practice.

#### Construindo Sistemas de Microserviços

Building Microservice Systems teaches what microservices are, how they
inherently facilitate the scaling up of robust production systems, and what's
available in the ecosystem to assist in microservice developmen

#### Deploying Node.js

Deploying Node.js demonstrates how to put a multiprocess Node.js system
into production, from containerizing processes with Docker to creating a
Kubernetes cluster, to building a CI deployment pipeline and deploying
associated infrastructure (such as a Docker Registry), to deploying an entire
system to a cloud provid
